# RS-232-Serial Calculator
A 4-function calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide) implemented in C for the C8051F020
microcontroller. Input/output is handled via RS-232 communication through a PuTTY serial terminal.
The project involved configuring UART, converting input strings to operands, and performing
arithmetic operations in real-time.
